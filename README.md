## Q&A

Q: Why Strapi?
A: Because we currently use it at work, and I wanted an excuse to dive deeper into Strapi.

Q: How much of the UI generated by V0 is still in the project?
A: Only the horizontal scrolling gallery component for project stories stayed from the v0 generation. The rest of the UI has progressively been rebuilt.
